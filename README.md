# Salary Calculator

## Description

We wanted a simple way to maintain a database of HR information.  The intuitive interface and functional tools included on the page allow anyone to successfully manage their data.

Using the DOM we can display the backend array of stored employee objects.  It can also be manipulated using the tools on the page.
